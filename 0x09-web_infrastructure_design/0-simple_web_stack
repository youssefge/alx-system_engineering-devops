Description of infrastructure components:

 server:

 A server is a computer or system used to provide certain services, resources, or data to other computers (often called clients) over a network. In the context of web hosting, a server is a computer that stores a website's files and makes them available to users visiting the website.
Domain name:

 A domain name is a human-readable address  used to access resources on the Internet. It provides a user-friendly way to identify websites and other online services. The Domain Name System translates "DNS" domain names into IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that computers use to identify each other on a network.  DNS entry for www:

 The "www" in a domain name like "www.foobar.com" is usually represented by a DNS record known as a "CNAME" record. CNAME stands for Canonical Name and  allows one domain name to be used as an alias for another domain name. In this case, the "www.foobar.com" CNAME record could point to the actual server hostname or IP address.
Web server:

 A web server is a software application or hardware  that stores web files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and serves those files to a user's web browser when the user requests her website. is. It handles incoming requests, processes them, and sends back  appropriate web content to display in the user's browser.  Application server:

 The application server is responsible for executing the business logic and application-specific tasks of a web application. It processes dynamic content, interacts with databases,  generates HTML or other data that is sent to the web server, and the web server delivers it to the user.
Database:

 A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. In the context of web applications, databases store information such as user profiles, content,  and transactions. They are essential for managing and delivering dynamic content.  Communication between the server and the user's computer:

 The server communicates with your computer over the Internet using  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or its secure version, her HTTPS. When the user types her web address into the browser, the browser sends her HTTP request to the appropriate server. The server processes the request and typically sends back an HTTP response containing the requested web content.
Infrastructure issues:

 Single point of failure (SPOF):

 A single point of failure occurs when a component in your infrastructure is so critical that if it fails, the entire system becomes unusable. For example, if you have only one web server and it crashes, your website will be offline. To mitigate this, redundancy can be introduced. B. Use multiple web servers in a load-balanced configuration.
Downtime during maintenance:

 To perform maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or updates, you may need to restart your web server. During this time, users may not be able to access the website. Downtime can be minimized by using techniques such as rolling updates that update servers individually.
Scalability challenges:

 A significant increase in incoming traffic to a website can overwhelm a single web server and cause slow performance and crashes. This lack of scalability can be addressed by using load balancing, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, and by using cloud-based solutions that can be easily scaled up or down as needed.
