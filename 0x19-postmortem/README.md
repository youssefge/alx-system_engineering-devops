Postmortem: Web Stack Downtime November 10, 2023 
Issue Summary:
 Duration: November 10, 2023, 2: 30 - 6:444 45 (UTC)
 Impact :  Add user authentication service drawback: 
 Impact: Add user authentication service Disadvantage: , affecting 30% of active users.
 Root Cause: Misconfiguration in  load balancing settings leads to increased traffic on the authentication server.
 Timeline: 
14: 30: The issue was discovered through an increased error rate on the authentication service.
 14: 35: Monitoring alerts are triggered when the error rate is high.
 14: 40: An initial investigation has begun, assuming a potential database connectivity issue.
 15: 00: Database connection checked; The focus has shifted to application servers.
 15: 30: Wrong assumption that recent code deployment may cause problems; start recovery.
 16: 00: Recovery completed; No improvement was observed.
 Reported to  infrastructure team.
 16: 30: Further investigation revealed that load balancing settings were misconfigured, resulting in uneven traffic distribution.
 17: 00: Load balancing settings have been fixed and traffic has begun to normalize.
 18: 45: Full service recovery confirmed.
 Root cause and resolution: Root cause: Misconfiguration in  load balancing settings causes traffic to be distributed unevenly, overloading the authentication server.
 Resolution : Fixed load balancing settings  to evenly distribute traffic between application servers, resolving bottlenecks.
 Corrective and preventive actions: Improvements/fixes: Check automatic load balancing configuration: Perform automated testing to verify load balancing configuration, preventing errors configuration.
 Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring systems to detect and alert on load balancer anomalies in real-time.
 Incident Response Training: Provide additional training for the team on efficient incident response and debugging strategies.
 Tasks to Address the Issue: Automated Load Balancer Checks: Implement a script to regularly check load balancer configurations, alerting on any deviations from best practices.
 Monitoring Enhancements: Add custom monitoring metrics specifically for load balancer health and distribution.
 Documentation Update: Update the incident response playbook with steps to investigate and correct load balancer-related issues.
 Team training: Conduct workshops on load balancing management and troubleshooting for  infrastructure teams.
 Conclusion:
 The outage on November 10, 2023 was due to misconfiguration in  load balancing settings, which increased traffic to the authentication server and made it unavailable.
 The initial assumption of a database problem led to  efforts being temporarily derailed during the investigation.
 Once identified,  corrective action includes adjusting  load balancing settings to evenly distribute traffic, thereby restoring service.
 To prevent future incidents, automated load balancing configuration testing, enhanced monitoring, and additional incident response training have been identified as important improvements.
 A series of specific tasks, including creating scripts for automated control and conducting workshops, were outlined to address these issues and strengthen the system against similar problems in the future.



Autopsy: The Great Authentication Service Tango Issue Summary: 
Duration: Nov 10, 2023, 14: 30 - 18: 45 (UTC) 
- The Authentication Service has decided to take a break
 - the coffee lasted.
 Impact : Authentication service  played hide and seek, causing 30% of our users to appear to have forgotten their keys at home.
 Root cause: The load balancer thinks it's a drunk DJ, mixing the beats and causing chaos on the server's dance floor.
 Timeline:
 2: 30: Authentication service sent a holiday postcard  - it's MIA.
 14: 35: Surveillance alarms sound like  smoke detectors when a cooking incident occurs.
 14: 40: Hats off to Sherlock Holmes!
 The initial investigation found the database innocent  but it was downright creepy.
 15: 00: I took a close look at the codebase  and restored it, but the authentication service still eludes us.
 16: 00: Called the Infrastructure SWAT team; they parachute in with theories more complicated than an episode of Black Mirror.
 16: 30: After some searching and muttering in the server logs, I realized that the load balancer was working overtime as a party DJ.
 17: 00: DJ Load Balancer has retrained itself in the art of fair server distribution.
 Prevent crises; The authentication service has woken up from its nap.
 18: 45: Authentication service returns from vacation and the party is over.
 Root cause and resolution: Root cause: The load balancer treats itself like a DJ, broadcasting favorites and overloading the authentication service.
 Resolution : DJ Load Balancer had problems with fairness and  beats being evenly distributed  across  servers.
 Corrective and Preventive Actions: Improvements/fixes: Automatic Load Balancing Jumps:  Instructs the Load Balancer  some smooth hops and automatically checks to ensure it not out of rhythm.
 Monitoring Swag: Upgrade monitoring to VIP status; Add sparkle to load balancer health and  server breakouts.
 meme-filled incident response playbook: Enhance your playbook with memes and gifs to boost your team's morale during your next investigation.
 Problem Solving Task: DJ Load Balancer Remix: Create a script to regularly check the load balancer configuration and send it to DJ school if it starts working.
 Server Log Karaoke: Conduct group training sessions  on reading server logs with the enthusiasm of a karaoke night.
 Post-outage celebration: Plan a team party to celebrate  the authentication service fix, with a dance between servers.
 Conclusion: In the epic tale of The Great Authentication Service Tango, the load balancer tried to stay ahead of the disco ball but ended up wreaking havoc on the server's dance floor.
 Our investigative work, including codebase interrogation and infrastructure SWAT intervention, led us to  DJ Load Balancer misconduct.
 With a crash course in fairness and a few stern words, we got things back on track and the authentication service was back up and running after the break.
 Lessons learned include improving our monitoring capabilities, adding humor to incident response, and preparing for a post-outage celebration with a dance between servers.
 Stay tuned for more tech adventures â€“ our servers have  some moves!
